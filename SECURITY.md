### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email us directly**: [SECURITY-CONTACT@example.com]
3. **Include the following information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and tested

## üîí Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Data Protection
- **No Data Transmission**: Calendar data never leaves your device
- **Minimal Storage**: No persistent storage of sensitive calendar data
- **Local Processing**: All operations happen locally on your device
- **Secure APIs**: Uses Android's official CalendarContract API

#### Permission Model
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions
- **Runtime Permissions**: Follows Android 6.0+ permission model
- **User Control**: Users can revoke permissions at any time
- **Clear Purpose**: Each permission has a clearly documented purpose

#### Code Security
- **Open Source**: Full source code is available for security auditing
- **No Obfuscation**: Code is transparent and reviewable
- **Static Analysis**: Code follows secure coding practices
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal external dependencies

### Android Platform Security

#### API Usage
- **Official APIs**: Uses only documented Android APIs
- **No Reflection**: Avoids potentially unsafe reflection operations
- **Secure Defaults**: Uses secure default configurations
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling prevents information leakage

#### Background Processing
- **WorkManager**: Uses Android's secure background processing framework
- **Limited Scope**: Background tasks have minimal permissions
- **Battery Optimization**: Respects Android's battery optimization features
- **Doze Mode Compatible**: Works with Android's power management

## üéØ Threat Model

### Identified Risks
1. **Calendar Data Exposure**: Risk of unauthorized access to calendar events
2. **Permission Abuse**: Risk of excessive permission usage
3. **Background Monitoring**: Risk of inappropriate background activity
4. **Full-Screen Display**: Risk of overlay abuse

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Data Minimization**: Only access data necessary for functionality
2. **Permission Justification**: Clear documentation of why each permission is needed
3. **Transparent Operation**: Open source code allows for verification
4. **User Control**: Users maintain full control over permissions and data

## üîç Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- **No Network Access**: App doesn't request internet permission
