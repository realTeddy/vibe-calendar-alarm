```

## üöÄ Building & Installation

### Step 1: Build the Phone App

```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd d:\repos\FullScreenCalenderReminer

# Build phone app APK
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Install on phone (phone must be connected)
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

### Step 2: Build the Wear OS App

```powershell
# Build Wear OS APK
./gradlew :wear:assembleDebug

# Install on watch (watch must be connected or emulator running)
./gradlew :wear:installDebug
```

### Step 3: Pair Phone and Watch

1. **Install Wear OS app** on your phone from Google Play Store
2. **Open Wear OS app** and follow pairing instructions
3. **Enable Developer Options** on watch:
   - Go to Settings > System > About
   - Tap "Build number" 7 times
4. **Enable ADB debugging**:
   - Settings > Developer options > ADB debugging: ON
   - Settings > Developer options > Debug over Wi-Fi: ON (optional)

### Step 4: Connect Watch via ADB

#### For Physical Watch:

**Option A: ADB over Wi-Fi**
```powershell
# On watch, go to Developer Options > Debug over Wi-Fi
# Note the IP address shown (e.g., 192.168.1.100:5555)

# Connect from computer
adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555

# Verify connection
adb devices
```

**Option B: ADB over Bluetooth**
```powershell
# Ensure phone is connected via USB
adb devices  # Verify phone is connected

# Enable port forwarding
adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub
adb connect 127.0.0.1:4444

# Verify watch is connected
adb devices  # Should show both phone and watch
```

#### For Wear OS Emulator:
```powershell
# Emulator connects automatically
# Verify with:
adb devices
```

### Step 5: Install Both Apps

```powershell
# Install phone app
adb -s <phone_serial> install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Install watch app
adb -s <watch_serial> install wear/build/outputs/apk/debug/wear-debug.apk
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Phone App Setup

1. **Open Vibe Calendar Alarm** on phone
2. **Grant all permissions**:
   - Calendar access
   - Notifications
   - Exact alarms
   - System alert window
   - Battery optimization exemption
3. **Schedule reminders** as usual

### Watch App Setup

1. **Open Vibe Calendar Alarm** on watch
2. **Grant permissions**:
   - Exact alarms (if prompted)
   - Battery optimization exemption
3. **Wait for sync** - calendar events will sync automatically from phone

## üîÑ How It Works

### Event Flow

```
1. Phone App schedules calendar reminder
   ‚Üì
2. Phone sends event data to watch via Wearable Data Layer
   ‚Üì
3. Watch receives data and schedules local alarm
   ‚Üì
4. At reminder time:
   - Phone: Shows full-screen ReminderActivity
   - Watch: Shows full-screen WearReminderActivity (simultaneously)
   ‚Üì
5. User dismisses on either device
   ‚Üì
6. Dismissal syncs to other device automatically
```

### Synchronization

- **Initial sync**: When phone app schedules reminders, automatically syncs to watch
- **Real-time updates**: New calendar events sync immediately
- **Dismissal sync**: Dismissing on phone dismisses on watch (and vice versa)
- **Boot recovery**: Watch re-syncs all reminders after device restart

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Watch Not Receiving Reminders

1. **Check phone-watch connection**:
   ```powershell
   # On phone, run:
   adb shell am broadcast -a com.google.android.gms.wearable.ACTION_CHECK_DEVICE_CONNECTION
   ```

2. **Verify Google Play Services**:
   - Both phone and watch must have Play Services installed
   - Check in Settings > Apps > Google Play Services

3. **Check watch battery optimization**:
   - Settings > Apps > Vibe Calendar Alarm > Battery > Unrestricted

4. **Check exact alarm permission** (Android 12+):
   - Settings > Apps > Vibe Calendar Alarm > Alarms & reminders > Allow

### Watch Shows "Waiting for phone connection"

- **Ensure watch is paired** with phone in Wear OS app
- **Check Bluetooth connection** between devices
- **Restart both devices** and wait for pairing to complete

### Full-Screen Not Showing on Watch

1. **Check system alert window permission**:
   - Some Wear OS versions restrict this
   - Alternative: Reminders will show as notifications

2. **Disable battery saver** on watch:
   - Settings > Battery > Battery Saver: OFF

### Alarms Not Waking Watch

- **Check Do Not Disturb** settings on watch
- **Ensure alarm volume** is not muted:
  - Settings > Sound > Alarm volume

## üì± Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Schedule a reminder 2 minutes in the future on phone
- [ ] Wait for sync (check logs: `adb logcat | grep "Wear"`)
- [ ] Verify alarm shows on both phone and watch simultaneously
- [ ] Test dismissing on phone - verify watch dismisses
- [ ] Test dismissing on watch - verify phone dismisses
- [ ] Test snooze on watch
- [ ] Test with phone disconnected (airplane mode)
- [ ] Test after watch reboot

### View Logs

**Phone logs:**
```powershell
adb -s <phone_serial> logcat | grep -E "WearCommunication|CalendarManager"
```

**Watch logs:**
```powershell
adb -s <watch_serial> logcat | grep -E "Wear|Reminder"
```

## üé® Customization

### Adjust Watch Fade-In Duration

Edit `wear/src/main/java/.../WearReminderActivity.kt`:

```kotlin
private val fadeInDurationMs = 20000L // Change to desired milliseconds
```

### Adjust Vibration Pattern

Edit `wear/src/main/java/.../WearReminderActivity.kt`:

```kotlin
val pattern = longArrayOf(0, 500, 1000) // [delay, vibrate, pause]
```

### Change Watch UI Colors

Edit `wear/src/main/res/values/colors.xml`:

```xml
<color name="red">#FFF44336</color>        <!-- Dismiss button -->
<color name="green">#FF4CAF50</color>      <!-- Snooze button -->
```

## üîê Privacy & Security

- **All data stays local**: Event data only syncs between YOUR paired devices
- **No cloud storage**: Data never leaves your phone-watch connection
- **Encrypted communication**: Uses Google's secure Wearable Data Layer
- **No internet required**: Works completely offline after initial pairing

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

1. **Keep apps updated**: Update both phone and watch apps simultaneously
2. **Battery optimization**: Exempt both apps from battery optimization for best reliability
3. **Regular syncing**: Open phone app occasionally to trigger re-sync
4. **Watch placement**: Keep watch on wrist with screen accessible for quick dismissal
5. **Testing**: Always test with real reminders before relying on them

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) section
2. Review logs from both phone and watch
3. Verify all permissions are granted
4. Try uninstalling and reinstalling both apps
5. Ensure devices are fully charged during testing

## üéâ Enjoy Your Un-Missable Reminders!

Your calendar reminders will now wake you up on both phone and watch with gradual audio, vibration, and full-screen alerts. Never miss an important event again! ‚è∞üéØ
