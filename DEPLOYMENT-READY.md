## 🎯 **Deployment Strategy**

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL RELIABILITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

**Issue Identified:** Alarms not firing reliably in background due to Android battery optimization.

**Root Cause:** Using `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()` which can be silently ignored by aggressive battery management.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **🔥 Upgraded to `setAlarmClock()`** - Highest priority alarm type that bypasses most restrictions
2. **🚨 Enhanced Battery Optimization Warning** - More aggressive user education about whitelisting
3. **🔄 Boot Receiver Improvement** - Automatically reschedules all alarms after device reboot
4. **📱 Better User Guidance** - Clear instructions on fixing battery optimization

**Result:** Maximum alarm reliability even on heavily restricted Android devices.
