# MainActivity Polish - Changelog

## Overview
Polished the MainActivity UI by implementing a cleaner, more Material Design-compliant interface with a hamburger menu and floating action button.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Hamburger Menu (Three-Dot Menu)
**Created:** `app/src/main/res/menu/main_menu.xml`

Menu items:
- 🔄 **Refresh & Auto-schedule** - Refreshes events and schedules alarms
- 📅 **Open Calendar** - Opens the device's default calendar app
- 🔐 **Permissions** - Opens the permissions management screen
- ⚙️ **Settings** - Opens the app settings

### 2. Removed Quick Actions Card
**Modified:** `activity_main.xml`

Removed the entire "Quick Actions" card that contained:
- Refresh button
- Calendar chip
- Settings chip  
- Permissions chip

This card cluttered the main screen and duplicated functionality now available in the menu.

### 3. Updated Toolbar
**Modified:** `activity_main.xml`

Added menu reference to the MaterialToolbar:
```xml
app:menu="@menu/main_menu"
```

The three-dot menu icon now appears in the top-right corner of the app bar.

### 4. Added Floating Action Button (FAB)
**Added to:** `activity_main.xml`

A floating action button for quick refresh access:
- Position: Bottom-right corner
- Icon: Refresh icon
- Function: Triggers refresh & auto-schedule
- Follows Material Design guidelines for primary actions

### 5. Updated MainActivity.kt

**Removed:**
- `setupClickListeners()` method (no longer needed)
- Click listeners for removed chips/buttons

**Added:**
- Toolbar menu item click handler
- FAB click listener for refresh action

### Benefits

## Design Decisions

### Why FAB for Refresh?
- Most common user action
- Material Design recommends FAB for primary screen action
- Always visible and accessible
- Provides quick access without opening menu

### Why Hamburger Menu?
- Industry-standard pattern for secondary actions
- Keeps UI clean
- Easy to discover for users
- Scalable for future menu items

### Why Remove Quick Actions Card?
- Redundant with menu
- Took up valuable screen space
- Made the screen feel cluttered
- Event list is more important to display

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions to the menu:
- Export events
- Backup/restore settings
- Help/tutorial
- About screen
- Share feedback
